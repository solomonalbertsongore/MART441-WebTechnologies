        "Listen man, I’ll explain it one more time. Last night some buddies and I had three goals; get f*cked up, meet some women, remember nothing. 
        Last I remember, our night started near 7isssh , at Hotel Dann..Carlson? Some sh*t like that in Zoogrande. Down at the lobby bar we took some Kamikaze shooots…some Mind Eraser shooooots…also threw some money at the blackjack table to make some cash for the evening. My buddy Sam - THE G - ended up pulling a blackjack, and we won 30 bigguns. After that we went back to the bar, bought a round for the house. 
        At some point we got a limo, and get this sh*t. The guys name was Santiago. Anyways, told em’ go to the nearest strip club, smokin some green in the back. He was the f*cking man, he came in with us and we partied for a fat minute. Around 2AM, a man rolled up to us on some skates. (So what was he wearing then?) He had a fedora hat on, with a hawaiian button up and lightning mcqeen crocs, sh*t was wack. He told us to call him Scooter.  He pulled out a small stash of coke from his jacket, and offered it to us. Let me tell yah snuffed that sh*t up before it hit the table. Madre de dios that sh*t was HARD. 
        Scooter said he had more stuff, even better than this last stash, but we had to hit up some sorta spot to get it. He said it was called Candy Land. So we f*cking bussed on outta there. Santiago seemed to think Scooter was a lil sus, but he ended up chilling. Who knows how long we were driving, but eventually we came to this fancy a*s restaurant near the coast...I only knew that cause the air smelled like McDonald’s french fries. 
        Anyways. Big f*ckin doors right. Golden Dragons on the side…like - in Mexico? Dah f*ck?""

        Joe: Absofuckinlutely. Let's ask some questions - shall we?
