            "Listen man, I’ll explain it one more time. Last night some buddies and I had three goals; 
            get fucked up, meet some women, remember nothing. Sadly that last part didn’t play out so well, but here’s what I know. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Last I remember, our night started near 7isssh , at Hotel Dann..Carlson? Some shit like that in Zoogrande. Down at the 
            lobby bar we took some Kamikaze shoooots…some Mind Eraser shooooots…also threw some money at the blackjack table to make 
            some cash for the evening. My buddy Sam - THE G - ended up pulling a blackjack, and we won 10 large. After that we went 
            back to the bar, bought a round for the house. 
            <br />
            <br />
            At some point the lobby bar was dull as fuck, so we got a limo. Get this shit, the limo driver's name was Santiago. Anyways, 
            told em’ go to the nearest strip club, smokin some green in the back. Santiago was the fucking man, so we brought him in with us 
            and we partied for a fat minute. Weed, shots, women. What could be better? I’ll tell yah what’s better, hard ass fucking drugs that’s what. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Around 2AM, a man rolled up to us on a scooter. He had a fedora hat on, with a hawaiian button up and lightning mcqeen crocs, shit was wack. 
            He told us to call him Scooter.  He pulled out a small stash of coke from his jacket, and offered it to us. Let me tell yah snuffed that shit up 
            before it hit the table. Madre de dios that shit was HARD. 
            Scooter said he had more stuff, even better than this last stash, but we had to hit up some sorta spot to get it. He said it was called Candy Land. 
            So we fucking bussed on outta there. Santiago seemed to think Scooter was a bad dude, but he ended up chilling. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Who knows how long we were driving, but eventually we came to this fancy ass restaurant. It was somewhere by the coast because the air was 
            saltier than McDonald’s french fries. 
            Anyways. Big fuckin doors right, and their were two guards on the side…like - the fuck? That made me and the homies a little nervous, but Scooter 
            said we were chillin. When we got out of the limo the guards seemed to know him. Cut to the inside. Bro, that shit was magical. Stained glass windows, 
            disco ball, checker tiled floor, lasers, all the shit…it was fuckin amazing! There was also a fuck ton of people there…I’m gonna guess around 300. 
            Scooter tells us to wait there, and that’s what we did. Grindin on bitches and more drinkin, nothing special. 
            <br />
            <br />
            He comes back and tells us to follow him. He led us through the crowd and we came to a door in the wall, nice ass door mind you, and went it. 
            More wack shit of course, but in the middle was a table with all the goods. Each item was weighed and bagged, with price tags. The drug I bought 
            was called “Fairies Dust.” Dude. The high was. A-MA-ZING. Shit made my whole life sparkle. 
            <br />
            <br />
            So there we are high as fuck in that room, sprawled out on some leather couches and in bust the fucking guards that were initially out front, plus some. 
            Big fuckin meatheads man. One of em walks over, grabs Scooter by the head and smashes his head into the table. Following them in walks who I’m assuming 
            was the boss. Nice ass suit, fancy as fuckin mustache like a pirate, and slicked back hair. Scooter called him Saint. Saint was fuckin pissed. He had the 
            guards fuck up Scoot pretty good, and then he noticed us. What does he do? He didn’t ask our names or anything, he just pulled out his gun. My friends and 
            I ran like a baby on rollerskates. We didn’t. Too fucking high to do anything. Saint walks over and takes aim, annnnnd. BOOM. THE DOORS BUST OPEN AGAIN, and this time theres a fucking army. 
            Next thing we know it’s a shootout. Bullets flying, people divin…shit was like Hollywood. 
            <br />
            <br />
            And the drugs didn’t help. There was a lot of shouting, barrel flashes…you know. For a second there was no gunfire, just two fuckheads screaming back and forth at each other. 
            I imagine that was Saint and another guy. Then the fire started up again. 
            We tried to baby crawl to the door, and BAM. Fuckin knocked out cold man. Woke up later in a van. Cold ass floor, couple of men with AK’s 
            and oni masks, aaaaand BAM. Fucking out again. The next time I woke up my head felt like an abused anvil, and my buddies and I were dumped on the beach. 
            We head back to town and several hours later your bitch asses show up. That’s all I got chief."
