This week was exceptionally hard for me. I'm not sure why, 
but I'm just having a hard time understanding the material. 
After extensive research on Google I am still struggling to 
display JSON data in a meaningful way. However, I am really 
enjoying learning about these new technologies and can see the 
power in them. Hopefully I will have a stronger understanding 
of them over the coming weeks.
