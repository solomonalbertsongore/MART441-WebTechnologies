This week went pretty well! I haven't coded in many months so it was a nice refresher. I did have some trouble with my second section (the skills list); just getting things to center properly and such. It's still not perfect, but I did the best I could. 

The other thing I struggled with was the mobile responsiveness. I designed it following the iPhone 12 Pro preset on chrome dev tools, but it ended up looking funky on my Galaxy...but I'm hoping it looks good on the majority of phones. 

I enjoyed learning about paralax scrolling and hero images, very useful tools for the future! I also thought the two articles regarding mobile responsiveness and breakpoints were fantastic. I'm familiar with both practices, but they were great reads and helped me learn even more about them! I'm actually going to link them below for future reference:

I also found these articles helpful:

Thanks for the great week!
