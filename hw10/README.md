This weeks homework has been quite challenging for me! Collision 
has always kind of confused me and this homework is no exception. 
I was able to get the color change going on collision, as well as 
console log a message when the "player" went out of bounds, but I'm 
not sure how to stop the shape or change it's size, even after 
looking at the example provided. I'm going to keep taking stabs at it 
though and hoepfully I'll figure it out!
