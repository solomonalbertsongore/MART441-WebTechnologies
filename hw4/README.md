This assignment went well for me, but it was a lot of work! I didn't realize 
how much thought would have to go into a game so simple. I struggled with the 
logic mostly, for example how I was going to track the players responses and 
then make a decision based off that, but after brainstorming I figured it out. 
I visited W3 and Stackoverflow a LOT for this one haha. 

I know this isn't exactly what was asked for, because there aren't 3 different routes, 
but there are 3 different possibilities, and it was a lot of work. I hope this is 
acceptable. Overall, it was a good week! I look forward to continuing it.
