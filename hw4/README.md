This week went pretty well! Implementing text boxes and changing 
data based on the input was pretty chill. The thing I struggled with
(and emailed the prof. about) was figuring out where to implement loops. 
With a game like this, I'm just not really sure where I would implement them. Another thing I couldn't figure out how to implement was a function that accepted a parameter and returned a value. Would this be the user input? Not sure, but I'm going to keep working on it.
