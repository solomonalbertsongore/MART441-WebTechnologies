This week I've been struggling quite a bit. I realized that during last 
weeks homework I made a mistake regarding populating the new images, and 
giving them all the same id's (so I can check if they match later). Also, 
I'm struggling to figure out how I'm going to determine if the player fails or not. And finally I had a rather stressful week, and haven't been able to set aside as much time as I would have liked for this homework. However, I'm going to continue to do my best and get it done!
