This week was fun and challenging for me! There were quite 
a few new concepts that I explored, especially with event 
listeners and element creation via JS. I had to do a lot 
of research and referencing to get to the goal for this week. 
I'm quite happy about it though now that it's all said and done! 
I tried to link all of the sources I refenereced for use later. 
Thanks for an interesting week!
